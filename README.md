# Laravel + Vue Starter Kit

A strict Laravel skeleton.

## Introduction

This Vue starter kit uses Vue 3 and the Composition API, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com) component library.

## Features

### âœ… Strict Models

Improves how Eloquent handles undefined attributes, lazy loading, and invalid assignments.

- Accessing a missing attribute throws an error.
- Lazy loading is blocked unless explicitly allowed.
- Setting undefined attributes throws instead of failing silently.

**Why:** Avoids subtle bugs and makes model behavior easier to reason about.

---

### ðŸ”“ Optional Unguarded Models

Disables Laravel's mass assignment protection globally (opt-in).

**Why:** Useful in trusted or local environments where you want to skip defining `$fillable`.

---

### ðŸ•’ Immutable Dates

Uses `CarbonImmutable` instead of mutable date objects across your app.

**Why:** Prevents unexpected date mutations and improves predictability.

---

### ðŸ”’ Force HTTPS

Forces all generated URLs to use `https://`.

**Why:** Ensures all traffic uses secure connections by default.

---

### ðŸ›‘ Safe Console

Blocks potentially destructive Artisan commands in production (e.g., `migrate:fresh`).

**Why:** Prevents accidental data loss and adds a safety net in sensitive environments.

---

### ðŸš€ Asset Prefetching

Configures Laravel Vite to preload assets more aggressively.

**Why:** Improves front-end load times and user experience.
